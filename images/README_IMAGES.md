# Image Placeholders

This folder contains placeholder image files for the MovieListApp Roku channel.

## Required Images

For a production Roku app, you would need to replace these placeholder files with actual images:

1. **mm_icon_focus_hd.png** (336x210) - Main menu icon when focused
2. **splash_hd.jpg** (1920x1080) - HD splash screen
3. **splash_fhd.jpg** (1920x1080) - Full HD splash screen
4. **focus_ring.png** (310x360) - Focus indicator ring for movie items

## Creating Your Own Images

### App Icons

- Use a 16:9 aspect ratio (336x210 pixels)
- Make it recognizable and related to your app
- Use contrasting colors that work on dark backgrounds

### Splash Screens

- HD: 1920x1080 pixels
- Should include your app name/logo
- Keep text readable and centered
- Consider Roku's safe zones for TV displays

### Focus Indicators

- Transparent PNG with colored border
- Should match your app's color scheme
- Make sure it provides good contrast
